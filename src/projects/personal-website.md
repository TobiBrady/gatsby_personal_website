description: This might seem like a bit of a cop out, including the website I have built to house my projects as a project on the same website, but stay with me on this. Every project I have undertaken is a new learning experience and this one is no different. Though building this website I have learnt the syntax and fundermentals of JavaScript, developed a solid understanding of the Gatsby framework and other static site generators, and been introduced to basics of React, a framework that I will pursure learning furthur. Thank you for indulging me. The website in the video below is the first version and has since been updated.
