description: A django application that lets users score the movies of the MARVEL Cinematic Universe once they have created an account and logged in. The scores are then averaged with all other users to give the total consensus for each movie. The movies can be viewed in order of averaged score, chonologically or by release date. This was one of my more challenging web development projects to date as I had a number of additional steps that I didn't foresee. I had to set up media storage on an additional web service, work out the complexities of setting up a database fit for my specific use case and navigate many other nuances in addition to learning the django framework. However, I am very proud of the resulting web application and I learnt a lot from the process.
