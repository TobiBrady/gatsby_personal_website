description: The first projects that I completed were simple command line programs written in python2. These projects included a rock, paper, scissors game, a battleships game and a blockchain program that utilised the python pickle library. The program that I have chosen to display here is a trigonometry calculator that returns all the angles and side lengths of any triangle if sufficient information is provided to perform any combination of sohcahtoa, the sine rule, the cosine rule or the pythagorean therom.
