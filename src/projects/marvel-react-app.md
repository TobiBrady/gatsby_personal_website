description: A simple React application that queries the MARVEL Comics API to return a random character upon every refresh. I was interested in learning about API’s, so I went hunting for one I would find interesting. This one tapped into my “slight” MARVEL obsession and here we are. The application queries the number of characters currently in the API, picks one at random, ensures that there are at least 5 comic books associated with the character and then returns the character along with their 5 most recently published comic books, and a smattering of associated information.
