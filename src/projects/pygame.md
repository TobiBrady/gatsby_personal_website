description: An arcade game written in python using the pygame library. The aim of the game is to collect all the coins and then the star while staying on the platforms and avoiding enemy frogs and blobs. I built all of the components in order to create a complete game (player, enemies, gravity, platforms, movement, collactables, etc) but fell short of finishing. I like to think that one day I'll revisit this pygame and build my own mario knockoff.
